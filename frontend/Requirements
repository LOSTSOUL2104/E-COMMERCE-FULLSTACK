2.2	Software Requirements:

1.	Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE): We needed a text editor or an IDE like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom to write and edit our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

2.	Node.js: Node.js is required for running the development server and managing dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager).

3.	ReactJS: Since weâ€™re building the app with ReactJS, we needed to set up a React environment using Create React App. This installed React and its dependencies for development.

3.	HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: These are the core technologies for building the frontend of our KBC quiz app. We wrote HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

4.	React Libraries and Dependencies: Depending on our app's specific requirements, we needed additional libraries for React.

5.	Version Control System: Used a version control system like Git along with a platform like GitHub or GitLab that helped with code management, collaboration, and version history tracking.

6. Tailwind CSS We need tailwind CSS as it is used for framework putpose in CSS.
